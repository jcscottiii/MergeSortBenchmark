MergeSortBenchmark
==================

Compares the execution time of merge sort for Java, C++, and Go for an Android application.

Go v1.4 will bring support for including Go-built code as .so that an Android application can use.
This application tests the execution time for Java, C++, and Go implementations of a Merge Sort algorithm.

The benchmark will prompt you if it completes succesfully.
During that prompt, it will tell you where to find csv files for each of the languages.
The csv files contain a list of array size and execution time pairs.

### Status
Currently WIP.

### TODOS
Add Go and C++ native libraries.

### Importing application
This application was made in Android Studio.
